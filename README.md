# Artifactory Resource
The Artifactory resource lets you integrate your pipeline jobs with maven repositories in Artifactory.

This integration allows:

- To deploy artifacts and poms generated by your build
- To retreive artifacts in a repository
- To trigger jobs when a new version of an artifact is available
## Source Configuration
* `host`: *Required.* The fully qualified domain name including the context root.
* `api_key`: *Required.* The API key of a user with sufficient read and write privileges on the repositories you wish to use
* `repository_id`: *Required.* The repository 
* `group_id`: *Required.* The maven groupId of your artifact
* `artifact_id`: *Required.* The maven artifactId of your artifact
### Example
Resource Type Configuration:
``` yaml
resource_types: 
  - name: artifactory
    type: docker-image
    source: 
      repository: emeraldsquad/artifactory-resource
```
Resource configuration for an artifact:
``` yaml
resources: 
  - name: my-artifact
    type: artifactory
    source: 
      api_key: <API KEY>
      artifact_id: wonderful-artifact
      group_id: emerald.squad
      host: "https://emerald.squad.com/artifactory"
      repository_id: repo-local
```
Retreiving artifacts:

``` yaml
- get: my-artifact
```

``` yaml
- get: my-artifact
  params: 
    qualifiers: [sources,javadoc]
```
Pushing local commits to the repo:
``` yaml
- put: my-artifact
  params:
    path: artifacts
```
## Behavior
### `check`: Check for new artifacts.
The resource searches for folders under `http(s)://<host>/<repository_id>/<group_id>/<artifact_id>`. It expects to get a list of valid maven versions (See https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVENOLD/Versioning for details). All subsequent versions of the given ref are returned. If no version is provided, the resource returns only the latest.
### `in`: Download the artifacts at the given ref.
Download the artifacts of the given ref to the destination. It will return the same given ref as version.
#### Parameters
* `qualifiers`: *Optional.* The artifacts classifiers ex: [source,javadoc]. If specified, the resource will only retreive the qualified artifacts.
### `out`: Push the artifacts to the repository.
Push the artifacts from the given path to the Artifactory maven repository. The resource will push every files presents in the folder specified in the **path** parameter. The version parameter is optionnal but the resource expect at least a version file containing a version in the format `<timestamp>-<git hash>`. You can easily generate a version of this format from your pipeline using the shell `echo "$(date +'%s')-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)" > version`.
#### Parameters
* `path`: *Required.* The path of the files to push to the repository.
* `version`: *Optional.* The path to a version file. Defaults to `<path parameter>/version`.
